--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
I continued my app from A4 so I kept in mind the same young adult users as I did when first designing the sleeptracking app. I added on an analytics page showing the user the averages of their data, helping out users who may want to know more about their sleeping patterns.

7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.
I created two custom gestures to navigate through the web app's pages that are shown in the nav bar (logs and analytics). The user can use 'One Open Hand and One Closed Hand' to navigate to the logs page and 'One Open Hand and One Pointing Hand' to navigate to the analytics page from the hand tracking feature in the home page.

8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?
I continue to use ionic components throughout my app so that everything flows well together even with the added hand tracking elements. The added analytics page and hand tracking components also adhere to the same color palette, fonts, and design aesthetic to tie the new elements with the old and keep a minimalist and consistent UI design.
