4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I talked with other classmates about routing different pages and components together.


5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
No.


--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
I designed my app with users like me in mind, young adults who are looking for an easy way to log their sleep.


7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
Both, when choosing certain elements I kept things simple and unspecific to certain operating systems.


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
A user will click on the "log my sleep" button on the home page and input the start and end time of their sleep and then press confirm to log it.
I felt like making the logging process as simple as possible would provide users with an easy way to track their sleep.


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
A user will click on the "log my sleepiness" button on the home page and input the level of sleepiness (based on the Stanford Sleepiness Scale) they feel and the date and time at which they felt that.
I made logging sleep possible through simply providing these two pieces of information, to allow users a quick way to describe their sleepiness during the day.


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
A user will select the logs tab on the bottom navigation bar and select on the top bar if they want to view their sleep or sleepiness data, displayed in distinct cards for each log that the user submitted with a summary of the info received.
I chose to display information this way so as to give user's an overview of the data that they logged and view important information from each log.


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
I chose to the additional feature of backing up logged data.


12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
N/A


13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
I back up the logged data to an IndexedDB database through ionic storage for angular.


14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
My application implements principles of good mobile design stylistically through my choice of color and consistent components. I wanted to make the sleep tracker app fit a "nighttime" aesthetic and chose my color palette accordingly. 
Additionally, I chose a sans serif font to be used throughout the entire application and tried to keep the app feel soft and gentle to use right when waking up. I kept a consistent UI through only using a bright color for buttons, and keeping the rest of the features fairly neutral.
